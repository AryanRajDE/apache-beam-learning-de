`Python Data Structure in Beam`

`1. List`  

List is a data type which contains an array of arbitrary elements that can be ordered, indexed and nested to an arbitrary depth. Lists are mutable and dynamic.

Lists are enclosed between square brackets [ ]

#### example : a = ['a', 1, 'hello', 9.87] 


`2. Tuple`

Tuple is identical to List but its elements are immutable and enclosed between two parentheses ( )

#### example : b = ('a', 1, 'hello', 9.87)


`3. Set`

Set is a mutable, unordered data structure, where its elements are unique and enclosed in curly brackets { }

#### example : c = {'a', 1, 'hello', 9.87}

You cannot save this set
c = {'a', 1, 'a', 9.87} // the element 'a' is not unique.

Output of c is
{1, 9.87, 'a'}

`4. Dictionary`

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates. 

Dictionaries are used to store data values in `{key:value}` pairs.

#### example : d = {'Sam':1, 'John':2, 'Adam':3}
