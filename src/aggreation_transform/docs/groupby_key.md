## `GroupByKey`

### `Input to GroupByKey`

The input to `GroupByKey` is a combination of `key/value pairs` that describe a multimap, i.e., multiple pairs with the same key but different values. For such cases, you use GroupByKey to collect all the values connected with each unique key.

Letâ€™s take an example where we have words (keys) from a text file and the line numbers (values) on which they appear. Our goal is to combine all the line numbers for a particular word.

I, 3
We, 6
You, 7
They, 9
Edpresso, 1
Educative, 2
You, 5
They, 4
Edpresso, 3
Educative, 8

### `Output of GroupByKey`
As discussed above, our goal is to get all the line numbers for a particular word.
Applying GroupByKey to this input, we get the output as:

I, [3]
We, [6]
You, [7, 5]
They, [9, 4]
Edpresso, [1,3]
Educative, [2,8]

The `GroupByKey` transform is for **bounded** data. To apply `GroupByKey` to **unbounded** data, you need to use windowing, otherwise Beam generates `IllegalStateException` while building the pipeline.
